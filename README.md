Project is still a WIP - I estimate to have the minimal viable product complete by 12/20/25.
Hosted on an eco web dyno, meaning the servers for the frontend and backend sleep after periods of inactivity.
Therefore, the first request you make will take time to respond, but will be very fast after that. I will look
into better deployment options upon completing the MVP.
